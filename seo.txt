How Google Search works?

    1. CRAWLING
        Google finds a new or updated webpages by either by
            a. following a link from a known page to a new page, or
            b. when a site owner submits a list of pages (a sitemap) for Google to crawl.
        
        Once Google discovers a page URL, it visits, or crawls, the page to find out what's on it. 
        Google renders the page and analyzes both the text and non-text content and overall visual layout 
        to decide where it should appear in Search results. To improve the site crawling
            a. Make sure that Google can able to reach the pages on site and ablt to understand all the 
                images and other elements of the page correctly.
            b. If a page is created or updated, submit an individual URL to Google. For this use sitemaps.
            c. If you ask Google to crawl only one page, make it your homepage.
            d. Get the page linked to by another page that Google already knows about.
    
    2. INDEXING
        After a page is discovered, Google tries to understand what the page is about and stores in the 
        Google index, a huge database. This process is called indexing.
        
        To improve indexing.
            a. Create short, meaningful page titles
            b. Use page headings that convey the subject of the page
            c. Use text rather than images to convey content. At minimum , annotate videos and images with 
                alt text and other attributes as appropriate
    
    3. SERVING / RANKING
        Google tries to find the most relevant answer from its index based on many factors.
            a. high quality answers
            b. best user experience
            c. user's location
            d. language
            e. device
        
        To improve serving and RANKING
            a. make pages fast to load, and mobile-friendly
            b. keep the page upto date
            c. provide user experience

How search performance is measured?
    Impressions: How many times the site has been seen by someone searching on Google.
    Clicks: How many times someone has clicked a link in the site in Google results.
    Average position: The average position of the site in search results.


BEST PRACTICES:
    a. Help Google find the content
        - Tell Google which pages to crawl and which pages not to crawl
        - For non-sensitive information, block the unwanted crawling by using robots.txt
        - For sensitive information, use more secure methods

    b. Help Google understand the content
        - Let Google see the page the same way a user does
            For optimal rendering and indexing, always allow crawler access to the Js, 
                CSS, and image files
        - Create unique, accurate page titles
        - Create good titles and snippets in search results
            Use <title> and <meta name="description" content=""> tags
        - Accurately describe the page's content
        - Create unique title for each page
        - Add structured data markup (rich results)

    c. Organize site hierarchy
        - Use breadcrumb lists
            Eg. HostName > Articles > Cloud Engineering
                Blogs | Cloud Engineering
        - Show usefull 404 pages
        - Use Simple URLs to convey the information

    d. Optimize the contents
        - Know what readers want
            Eg. FIFA and football playoffs
        - Organize the topics clearly
        - Optimize the contents for users, not search engines
        - Contents should be factually accurate, clearly written, and comprehensive.
    
    e. Avoid Distracting advertisements

    f. Use links wisely
        - Write good link text
        - Format links so they are easy to spot

    g. Optimize images
        - Use HTML image elements i.e., <img> or <picture> elements
        - Avoid using CSS to display image
        - Use alt attribute for providing image descriptions
        - Help search engines to find images by using image sitemaps
        - Use standard image formats

    h. Make site mobile-friendly
        - Responsive web design
        - Dynamic serving
        - Separate URLs
        - Provide full functionlaity on all devices

    i. Promote the website
        - Make sure that the website URL is listed in business cards
        - Use newsletters

    j. After the crawling and indexing improvements, monitor the traffic coming to 
        the site.
        - Discover the most popular content on the site
